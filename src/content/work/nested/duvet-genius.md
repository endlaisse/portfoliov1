I am excited to introduce my innovative solution for mass email sending, developed in Node.js. Designed to meet the needs of modern users, this email sender offers a multitude of advanced features to optimize your email campaigns.

Key Features:
Drag and Drop Email Files:
I have simplified the process of importing your contact lists with an intuitive drag-and-drop feature. Simply drag your files containing the emails directly into the interface for instant loading.

Simultaneous Use of Multiple SMTP Servers:
I have integrated the ability to enhance the reliability and speed of your email deliveries by using multiple SMTP servers in parallel. This feature enables intelligent distribution of emails, ensuring better deliverability and reducing the risk of blocking.

Adjustable Sending Frequency:
You can precisely control the pace of your email sends by adjusting the frequency according to your needs. Whether per minute, per hour, or per day, you have the flexibility to set the ideal cadence for your campaigns, ensuring optimal management of quotas and resources.

I chose Node.js for this project to ensure compatibility with secure Amazon AWS EC2 servers, providing a reliable and scalable environment for your email sending needs.

My Node.js email sender is the perfect solution for businesses and individuals looking to efficiently manage their email campaigns with a user-friendly interface and robust features. Try it today and discover the power of simplified email sending management.
