> Project: Redesign of the "Geek Factory License" Showcase Website
Objective
The main goal of this project was to modernize and optimize the "Geek Factory License" showcase website to enhance the user experience across all types of devices, particularly mobile devices.

Achievements
1. Complete Responsive Redesign
Description: I entirely redesigned the website with a responsive approach. This means the site now automatically adjusts to the screen size of any device, providing an optimal user experience on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.
Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid Layout), Media Queries.
2. Integration of Frameworks and JavaScript Animations
Description: To improve interactivity and visual appeal, I added several JavaScript animations. These include smooth page transitions, hover effects, and scroll animations.
Frameworks Used:
Bootstrap: To speed up development with reusable components and a robust grid system.
jQuery: For easier DOM manipulation and animations.
AOS (Animate on Scroll): To enrich the visual experience with scroll-triggered animations.
3. Implementation of a PHP Contact Form
Description: I created and integrated a functional contact form that allows users to send messages directly through the website. The information submitted by users is processed by a PHP script and then emailed to the "Geek Factory License" team.
Features of the Contact Form:
Client-side and server-side validation to ensure all required fields are correctly filled.
Spam protection using Google reCAPTCHA.
Confirmation message upon successful form submission.
Outcome
With these improvements, the "Geek Factory License" website is now more user-friendly, modern, and accessible on all devices. The added animations and interactive features have made navigation more engaging and visually appealing for visitors.
